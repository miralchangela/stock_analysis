## Overview of Project
### Purpose 
The purpose of this analysis was to refactore a code to collect the information of certain stock information in the year 2017 and 2018.This analysis gives result to determine if the Stocks are worth investing money. Furthermore , the main reason of this analysis was to improve efficiency of the code.
### The  Given Data
The data that is presented includes two sheets with stock information on 12 different stocks. The stock information sheets have a ticker value, the date the stock was issued, the opening, closing and adjusted closing price, the highest and lowest price, and the volume of the stock. The task is to retrieve the ticker, the total daily volume, and the return on each stock.
## Results
### Analysis of various stocks for 2017 and 2018
In this stock analysis I have done it in 2 different ways, At click of a button one , that enable macros which run a code written using nested loops while click of a another button which enable to the other refactored the code written using different conditions.Both codes give same results but its having different efficiency.simple code takes more time to complete the analysis where refactored code run to fast compare to this.the result of stock market analysis in the year 2017 and 2018.The table below contains three groups of data:
1) Ticker name.
2) Total daily volume for a given year.
3) Percentage of a yearly return.

## Summary
### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code? 
**Advantage of refactoring code:** 
- **readability** - Refactored code is easier to understand, clean and more organized.
- **cost efficative** - Refactored code reduces repeated errors in the future and simplifies the implementation of new software functionality'
- **functionality** - fixing any bugs that might have been overlooked in the original code,
- **efficiency** - Refactored code is taking fewer steps, therefore taking up less computer memory and taking-up less time to execute the code.

**Disadvantage of refactoring code:**
- **Time consuming** -  we might be aware of functionality of the code. Especially when the code is not well commented and it takes a lot of time to figuring out what specific lines of code are supposed to do.
- **Chance of mistakes** - refactoring code  went wrong, will have to waste much more time in solving the problem and there are probable chances that it may go wrong due to complexity of the code.

### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
- When we are refactoring the original VBA Script , we faces some prons and cons. refactoring code helps make our code cleaner and more organized.It may also benefit other users who view our projects because it becomes easier to read, as it is more concise and straightforward. the main pros of refactored code is its efficiency because it takes very less amount of time to execute the code. Here both images are representing  time efficency of simple code and refactored code.From the image ,We can see that refactored code ran in just 0.4 seconds where simple code ran in approximately in 2 miniutes. Simple code took five times higher than refactored code.

**Time efficency of Simple code**

- The main cons of the refactored code is to imprecise refactoring could introduce new bugs and errors into the code.
